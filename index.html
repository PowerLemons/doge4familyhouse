			<h1>About Doge 4 Family House</h1>
			<p>Ever since Dogecoin's inception, its community has always been on the forefront of cryptocurrency. Unlike your typical paper money sitting in your wallet right now, <a href="http://dogecoin.com/" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> is a currency with a fun and passionate community filled with memes, activism, and a desire to do good. That means the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/" target="_blank">/r/dogecoin</a> subreddit, our online discussion board, is for everyone - not just for financiers. This includes charitable individuals who want to make an impact!<br><b>Hence why we started up fundraisers in the past:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>to bring clean water to Kenyans (Doge 4 Water)</p></li>
				<li><p>to provide rental and mortgage grants to Minnesota families with critically ill or seriously injured children (Doge 4 Housing)</p></li>
				<li><p>...and many more!</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Now, in 2017, we need YOUR help in giving back to those in need!</b><br>Family House is a wonderful organization that offers families with a child or children being treated for a serious illness at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital a place to stay in San Francisco, California. They free families from any financial burdens of a costly hotel room, but not only that, they also give physical comfort and emotional support to their guests.<br>/u/DogcoinFanatic, one of the members of our community, used their services first-hand when his family needed it. Other guests at Family House, just like him and his family, can also benefit with your donations!</p>

			<h1>Family House in San Francisco, California</h1>
			<p><b>According to the Family House website:</b><br>"Founded in 1981, Family House is a 501(c) (3) not-for-profit organization providing temporary housing to families of seriously ill children receiving treatment at the University of California San Francisco Benioff Children’s Hospital.<br>Qualifying families live more than 50 miles from UCSF, and many live at or below the low-income status as determined by UCSF. Our location sustains nearly a 100% occupancy rate and can accommodate 240 people per night. Over the course of a year we serve more than 3,000 families." - <a href="http://familyhouseinc.org/what-we-do/">Source</a></p>

			<h1>What the 1,500,000 Dogecoin will help do</h1>
			<p>Parents from all over the world bring their children to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital without any means to pay for the high cost of a hotel room in San Francisco, California. Family House eases this stressful burden by offering a place for families to stay while their children undergo treatment.<br>We started this fundraising campaign to help serve the needs of these families during one of their most stressful times, and we need your help.<br>100% of the funds raised will be donated to the Family House organization.<br><b>Your donations will help sponsor:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Direct support for families, such as gas cards, food supplies, diapers and other essentials items.</p></li>
				<li><p>Maintainment of residential services and a healthy facility for guests.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will be converting the funds from DOGE to USD before the donation is made.</p>
			<h1>/u/DogcoinFanatic's Experience at Family House</h1>
			<p>"It's a good place to donate too. I've experienced this place first hand when I was younger and they really do care about the people that come to the 'Family House'. My family didn't have to pay one cent while we stayed there. I see on the donation page you can donate for Christmas, could you imagine if we were a Santa for the whole 'FAMILY HOUSE'? What publicity that would bring DOGECOIN? San Francisco? VC's?"<br>- /u/DogcoinFanatic</p>
			<h1>Who are you?</h1>
			<p>Hi, I'm Minh Tran. I created Dogecoin.com and helped developed the reddit /u/sodogetip tip bot. And I'm looking forward to seeing this fundraiser help a lot of people!<br>/u/DogcoinFanatic talks about stuff here.<br>/u/Sporklin talks about stuff here.<br>/u/Fulvio55 talks about stuff here.<br>/u/langer_hans talks about stuff here.<br>Doge 4 Water placeholder image by Thanh Ma.</p>
